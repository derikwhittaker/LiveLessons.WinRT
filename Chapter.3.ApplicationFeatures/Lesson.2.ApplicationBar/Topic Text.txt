Introduction
When building Windows 8 applications you are more than likely going to have the need to use the application bar.  The application bar is the 
preferred way to provide ways for the user to 'control' or 'interact' with your application.  This is because the bar can be customized to 
meet pretty much any need and simply 'gets out of your way' when it is not in use.
