When building a Windows 8 application it is almost a given that you are gonig to have multiple pages inside your app and
its also a given you will need to navigate between these pages.  The question is how do you handle this navigation?  How do you pass
parameters or values between pages and finally how do you do this inside your view model?  This is exactly what we are going to look 
here.

* setup the dashboard vm to take the frame
            var frame = Window.Current.Content as Frame;
            DataContext = new DashboardViewModel(frame);

* setup the dashboard vm to navigate to the first page
	* talk about how we are going to use the _currentFrame.navigate
	* talk about how with Win 8 the typcial navigation is view first, not view model first

        public RelayCommand SimpleNavigationCommand
        {
            get { return _simpleNavigationCommand ?? (_simpleNavigationCommand = new RelayCommand(SimpleNavigation)); }
        }
        
        private void SimpleNavigation()
        {
            _currentFrame.Navigate(typeof (SimpleNavigationPage));
        }

* run the application

* time to look at some of the build in features such as goBack / goFoward

* Add the logic to go forward
        public RelayCommand SimpleNavigationWithForwardCommand
        {
            get
            {
                return _simpleNavigationWithForwardCommand ??
                       (_simpleNavigationWithForwardCommand = new RelayCommand(SimpleNavigationWithForward));
            }
        }

        private void SimpleNavigationWithForward()
        {
            if ( _currentFrame.CanGoForward )
            {
                _currentFrame.GoForward();
            }
        }

* run the app

* talk about how we can listen to navigation events in order to do something important
	* open the layoutawarepage

* setup the nav events        
        public RelayCommand SimpleNavigationWithEventsCommand
        {
            get { return _simpleNavigationWithEventsCommand ?? (_simpleNavigationWithEventsCommand = new RelayCommand(SimpleNavigationWithEvents)); }
        }

        private void SimpleNavigationWithEvents()
        {
            _currentFrame.Navigated += (sender, args) => { Debug.WriteLine("Navigation Completed"); };
            _currentFrame.Navigating += (sender, args) => { Debug.WriteLine("Navigation In Progress"); };
            
            _currentFrame.Navigate(typeof(SimpleNavigationPage));
        }

* run the app

* talk about how we can pass values from page to page

* setup the command

        public RelayCommand SimpleNavigationWithArgumentsCommand
        {
            get { return _simpleNavigationWithArgumentsCommand ?? (_simpleNavigationWithArgumentsCommand = new RelayCommand(SimpleNavigationWithArguments)); }
        }

        private void SimpleNavigationWithArguments()
        {
            _currentFrame.Navigate(typeof(ArgumentNavigationPage), "Some Value");
        }

* talk about how we have to get these values
	_frame.Navigated += (sender, args) =>
                                    {
                                        PassedArgument = args.Parameter.ToString();
                                    };

* run the app

* now put a break point in this event and navigate to another page.  talk about how this will first for ALL navigation

* fix the issue

_frame.Navigated += HandleNavigated;

        private void HandleNavigated(object sender, NavigationEventArgs args)
        {
            if ((args.NavigationMode == NavigationMode.New || args.NavigationMode == NavigationMode.Forward)
                && args.SourcePageType == typeof(ArgumentNavigationPage))
            {
                PassedArgument = args.Parameter.ToString();
            }
            else
            {
                _frame.Navigated -= HandleNavigated;
            }
        }
