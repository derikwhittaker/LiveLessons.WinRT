Introduction
As a windows 8 developer it you will be required to understand and utilize the 3 life cycle states that all applications can utilized.  Applications can go from launched, to suspended
to resumed on a very regular basis and if you do not understand how to handle each of the states you users will not have a good experiance in your application.

* We are going to learn about the 3 different states which are
	* Launching - this is when the application first starts
	* Suspending - This is when the applicaiton is not longer n the forground and Windows is attempting to 
		reclaim its used resources
	* Resuming - this is when a suspended appliction is being started again
* We are gonig to learn how to handle and debug each of the life cycle states
* We are going to learn how to use each state in order to save and repopulate information in your application

Summary
In this lesson we learned about the 3 life cycle states your application can go.  We also learned how we can use and debug these states

* We learned about the 3 different states which are
	* Launching
	* Suspending
	* Resuming
* We learned how to handle and debug each of the life cycle states
* We learned how to use each state inside our application.
	
* so how do we handle and work with the 3 different life cycle events?  Fortucnatily for use the default template for windows 8 applications
does much of the heavy lifting for use.

* launch the app with NO debugger and show it going to suspension mode
	* via the task manager

* walk though and take a look at the Launching event
	* point out how the prior execution state is provided via an arg and you can handle them if needed.


* launch the application again but with the debugger attached and try to get it to suspend
	* explain why it will not suspend
	* explain that we cannot really debug these actions because of this but they have provided
		a way. 
		* right click the menu and select 'Debug Location'
		* point out the options
		* run the app and show how each of the states work these work

* walk though the template and how it sets up OnSuspending for you.
	* mention that this code will ONLY manage your location within the application
		and NOT your data
	* mention you have a total of 5 seconds to complete any saving
	* point out what the deferral does


* now lets wire up and talk about the resume event
	* this is not needed to re-hidrate our previous state as the generated state manager wll
		handle this for you.
	* this can be used to possible rebuild your application data if it is populated via a remote source, such as web server or remote API


* add the resume event handler
* create the IResumable interface
	* add it to our underlying VM
    public interface IResumable
    {
        void Resume();
    }

* create the OnResume code
        private void OnResuming(object sender, object o)
        {
            var asFrame = Window.Current.Content as Frame;

            var layoutAwarePageContent = ((LayoutAwarePage) asFrame.Content);

            if (layoutAwarePageContent != null)
            {
                if (layoutAwarePageContent.DataContext is IResumable)
                {
                    var asIResumable = ((IResumable) layoutAwarePageContent.DataContext);
                    asIResumable.Resume();
                }
            }
        }
