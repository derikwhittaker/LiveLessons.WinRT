Introduction
When building windows 8 application developers must understand and utilize the application life cycle events in order to give their users a greate
experiance.  These events allow us to know when an application is starting, when it is being suspended and when it is resuming from a suspended state.
Knowing how to react to these events will allow you to build applications that users can trust and feel good using.  We are going to take a look at
each of these 3 events in detail and understand the importance these event play in building windows 8 applications.

* We are going to learn how to about the 3 different life cycle states of an application
	* Launching the applciation - this is when it is opened/started
	* Suspending - this is when the application is lost focus and the OS will reclame any system resources and potentially shut down your application
	* Resuming - this is when an applciation is restarted from a suspended state
* We are gonig to learn how to handle and debug each of the 3 life cycle states inside of VIsual studio
* We are going to learn how to use each life cycle state in order to save the current state of your application and use that state at a later time

Summary
In this lesson we learned about the settings contract and how we can use this to expose application or page level settings
to our user in a consistant way

* talk about the 3 parts of the application life cycle
	* Launching
	* Suspending
	* Resuming

* walk though the template and how it sets up OnSuspending for you.
	* mention that this code will ONLY manage your location within the application
		and NOT your data
	* mention you have a total of 5 seconds to complete any saving
	* point out what the deferral does

* launch the app with NO debugger and show it going to suspension mode
	* via the task manager
* launch the application again but with the debugger attached and try to get it to suspend
	* explain why it will not suspend
	* explain that we cannot really debug these actions because of this but they have provided
		a way. 
		* right click the menu and select 'Debug Location'
		* point out the options
		* run the app and show how these work

* Start w/ coding of the suspend
