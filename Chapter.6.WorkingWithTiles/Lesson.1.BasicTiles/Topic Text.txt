Introduction
Windows applications have had icons dating back to Windows 3.1, but it was not until Windows 8 tha the icon was re-imagined and updated.  Windows 8 has brought us the concept
of the tile, more importantly it has given us live tiles.  Tiles give your application to engage and inform the user without the need for them to even open your application.

Basic tiles

1) launch the application with NO tile changes
	-> point out the default tile on desktop
	-> point out the default tile in app search
	-> point out there is not option for larger tile

2) Add the images, run the application
	-> point out the new tile on desktop
	-> point out the new tile in app search
	-> point out there is now an option for larger tile
		-> show how to switch between the large and small
		-> Talk about how if you do not put in a large tile you will ONLY get a small one and no option for a large one

6) Go back to package.appxmanifest and add the lock screen
	-> Do not set the background color
	-> point out that the splash image does NOT stretch to fill and that you will want to either make it transparent OR change the background color

7) Go back to package.appxmanifest and setup the background color
	-> #757575

3) Go back to the application and enter value into 'short name'
	-> Launch the app and show we can provide this

4) Go back to package.appxmanifest and change the 'show name' to only be on wide
	-> Launch the app and show this only working on wide

5) Go back to package.appxmanifest and change the forground text form light to dark
	-> Launch the app and show the dark text
