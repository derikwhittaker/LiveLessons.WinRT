Introduction

When building windows 8 applications one of the really cool controls is the flip view.  This is great because it allows your users to 'flip' through data by swipping from side to side or up and down.  With 
the flip view you can each item in your view contain similuare data or competly different data.

* We are going to learn how to use a basic flip view
* We are gonig to learn how to change and manipulated the styles of the fip view
* We are going to learn how to handle user selection of items in the flip view.

Summary
In this lesson we learned about the flip view and how to use it within our application
* We learned how to use a basic flip view
* We learned how to change and manipulated the styles of the flip view
* We learned how to handle user selection of items in the flip view.

When building windows 8 applications one of the really cool controls is the flip view.  This is great because it allows your users to 'flip' through data by swipping.  You can have each
item in the viwe have different data.  we will start off by loooking at the basic ways to use a flip view.  We will then move on to how we can add custom
styling to the control and finally take a look at how we can get the current item which is being shown in the view and use that to populate other data.
               
***** Basic Flip View ****

* show the base vm
* setup the base flipview xaml
            <TextBlock Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="0" Text="Simple Flip View" />
            
            <FlipView Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="1" ItemsSource="{Binding Items}" >

            </FlipView>

* launch the app -- show how we are not able to see anything because of the lack of a data template

* Add in the item template
            <FlipView.ItemTemplate>
                <DataTemplate>
		    <Grid VerticalAlignment="Top">
                        <Image Source="{Binding ImageName}" />
                    </Grid>
                </DataTemplate>
            </FlipView.ItemTemplate>

* run the appliction

*** Styled Flip View ****
* add the collectionview source
        <CollectionViewSource
            x:Name="ItemsSource"
            Source="{Binding Items}"
            d:Source="{Binding Items, Source={d:DesignInstance Type=vm:DashboardViewModel, IsDesignTimeCreatable=True}}"
            />

* add the header label 

            <TextBlock Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="1" Text="Styled Flip View" 
                       Style="{StaticResource TitleTextStyle}" HorizontalAlignment="Center"
                       Margin="5,10"/>

* copy the other flip view -- change the itemsSource
            <FlipView Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="1" ItemsSource="{Binding Source={StaticResource ItemsSource}}" >
            <FlipView.ItemTemplate>
                <DataTemplate>
		    <Grid VerticalAlignment="Top">
                        <Image Source="{Binding ImageName}" />
                    </Grid>
                </DataTemplate>
            </FlipView.ItemTemplate>
            </FlipView>

* update the style to show more content
                        <Grid VerticalAlignment="Top">
                            <Grid.RowDefinitions>
                                <RowDefinition Height="auto" />
                                <RowDefinition Height="*" />
                            </Grid.RowDefinitions>
                            
                            <Border Grid.Row="0" Height="50" Background="Gray" Opacity=".5">
                                <TextBlock Style="{StaticResource SubtitleTextStyle}" Foreground="White"
                                           Text="{Binding Title}" VerticalAlignment="Center" />
                            </Border>
                            
                            <Image Grid.Row="1" Source="{Binding ImageName}" />
                        </Grid>

* change the item tempate to do verticle swips
                <FlipView.ItemsPanel>
                    <ItemsPanelTemplate>
                        <VirtualizingStackPanel Orientation="Vertical" />
                    </ItemsPanelTemplate>
                </FlipView.ItemsPanel>

**** Current Item Grid View ****
* copy the style grid view

* update the flipview
SelectedItem="{Binding SelectedItem, Mode=TwoWay}"

        public Item SelectedItem
        {
            get { return _selectedItem; }
            set
            {
                _selectedItem = value;

                OnPropertyChanged("SelectedItem");
            }
        }

* update the UI to show the name of the select item in the main title
            <StackPanel Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="2" Orientation="Horizontal" HorizontalAlignment="Center">
                <TextBlock Text="Active Item Flip View" 
                       Style="{StaticResource TitleTextStyle}" HorizontalAlignment="Center"
                       Margin="5,10"/>
                
                <TextBlock Text="{Binding SelectedItem.Title}" 
                       Style="{StaticResource TitleTextStyle}" HorizontalAlignment="Center"
                       Margin="5,10"/>
            </StackPanel>

* point out how 2 flip views will change at the same time since they are using the same collection source
