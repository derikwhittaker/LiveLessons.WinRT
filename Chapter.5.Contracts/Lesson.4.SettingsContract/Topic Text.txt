Introduction
With the introduction of Windows 8 developers now have the ability to utilize the various contracts, such as the search, share and settings contracts.  These contracts
give your application the ability to appear integrated with both the core operating system, they also give your uses a consistant experiance between applications to perform
these common tasks.  We are going to take a look at how you can integrate the Settings contract into your applicaiton.  This contract allows your application to expose its
settings via the Settings charm and give users a consistant experiance across all Windows 8 applications

* We are going to learn how to get access to the Settings pane for the current view
* We are gonig to learn how to define which settings options are available for the current view
* We are going to learn how to launch our settings pane and manipuate controls on the view

Summary
In this lesson we learned about the settings contract and how we can use this to expose application or page level settings
to our user in a consistant way

* We learned how to get access to the Settings pane for the current view
* We learned how to define which settings options are available for the current view
* We learnedhow to launch our settings pane and manipuate controls on the view
	

* Get access to the Settings pane for the current view
	* talk about how the OnSettingsCommandsRequested; method will be invoked EACH time the user clicks the settings charm
		show this

        private void EnableSettings()
        {
            if (!_commandsAreEnabled)

            }
            else
            {
                SettingsPane.GetForCurrentView().CommandsRequested -= OnSettingsCommandsRequested;

        {

* Setup the about setting

        private void OnSettingsCommandsRequested(SettingsPane settingsPane,

            var aboutPage = new SettingsCommand("aboutPage", "About", aboutCommandHandler);          

	    eventArgs.Request.ApplicationCommands.Add(aboutPage);  
        }

        private void OnAboutCommandInvoker(IUICommand command)
        {
            
        }

* setup the settings command
	take a look at the Settings VM

        private void OnSettingsCommandsRequested(SettingsPane settingsPane,
                                              SettingsPaneCommandsRequestedEventArgs eventArgs)

            eventArgs.Request.ApplicationCommands.Add(settingsPage);      
        }

        private Popup settingsPopup;
        private double settingsWidth = 646;
        private Rect windowBounds = Window.Current.Bounds;

            // Create a SettingsFlyout the same dimenssions as the Popup.
            var mypane = new SettingsFlyoutPage
                {
                    DataContext = this.Settings
                };

            mypane.Width = settingsWidth;
            mypane.Height = windowBounds.Height;

            settingsPopup.Child = mypane;

            settingsPopup.SetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty, SettingsPane.Edge == SettingsEdgeLocation.Right ? (windowBounds.Width - settingsWidth) : 0);
            settingsPopup.SetValue(Canvas.TopProperty, 0);
            settingsPopup.IsOpen = true;
        }

        private void OnWindowActivated(object sender, WindowActivatedEventArgs e)

        private void SettingsPopupOnClosed(object sender, object o)
        {

        }

* show the settings view, point out the toggle switch is bound to the VM
* show the button click event which closes the popup

* run the app
	* point out how the settings pane does NOT transition well
	* add the transition

            settingsPopup.ChildTransitions = new TransitionCollection();
            settingsPopup.ChildTransitions.Add(new PaneThemeTransition()
            {
                Edge = (SettingsPane.Edge == SettingsEdgeLocation.Right) ?
                       EdgeTransitionLocation.Right :
                       EdgeTransitionLocation.Left
            });

* run the app
	* have it function as expected
