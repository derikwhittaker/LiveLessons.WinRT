Introduction
When building Windows 8 applications the user experiance should be one of the most important features you pay attention to.  It is important that you create
a user interface and user experiance that is both smooth and compelling.  This is where the Visual State Manager comes into play.  The visual state manager is the 
way you can control the visual experiance of your application as its state changes.  With the Visual State Manager you can do things like change visual appearance
when a control is clicked or when it is disabled

* We are going to learn how to use the visual state manager and understand its role in building xaml based applications
* We are gonig to learn how to take a 3rd party control and change its visual behavior by using the V S M
* We are going to learn how to use the V S M when building and styling your own custom controls

Summary

Drop a Toggle Switch onto the screen
Drop a button onto the screen
Open the solution in Blend

Drop a buton and toggle switch on the scren.
Wire the button up

MyToggleSwitch.IsEnabled = !MyToggleSwitch.IsEnabled;

right click the toggle switch and 'edit Tamplate'	
	- Give it a name
	- Use this document
	- Split the screen
Talk about how this will allow you to customize the look and feel of the control
Open the states panel
	- Talk about the Visual State Groupings
	- Talk about the individual states

Add a transition for the OnContent
	- On -> Off
	- set a 1s duration
	- Run the application

Add a transition to change the color of the selector
	-> Disabled 
	-> Make the selector red
	-> Enabled - Make the selector white
	-> Normal -> Disabled
	-> .5s time
	-> select the selector - Make it red
	-> Disabled -> Normal
	-> .5s
	-> Select the selector - Make it white

Run the application -> show it working


STOP RECORDING... BREAK TIME


Time to create a custom control
	-> this will be shelled out -> Minus templates
	-> Talk about how we want to create groups and states in order to allow the VSM to manage tem

Create the interaction state
    [TemplateVisualState(Name = "Selected", GroupName = "InteractionGroup")]
    [TemplateVisualState(Name = "UnSelected", GroupName = "InteractionGroup")]

Create the Common States
    [TemplateVisualState(Name = "Enabled", GroupName = "CommonStates")] 
    [TemplateVisualState(Name = "Disabled", GroupName = "CommonStates")]

Go back to blend and show then inside the V S M
	Oen Generic.xaml

Select the Selected state
	-> Select the text
		-> Change the text size for each

Wire up the tapped event
            AutoImage = GetTemplateChild("AutoImage") as Image;
            AutoImage.Tapped += AutoImageOnTapped;

        private bool _tapped = false;
        private void AutoImageOnTapped(object sender, TappedRoutedEventArgs tappedRoutedEventArgs)
        {
            if (!_tapped)
            {
                VisualStateManager.GoToState(this, "Selected", true);   
            }
            else
            {
                VisualStateManager.GoToState(this, "UnSelected", true);   
            }
            _tapped = !_tapped;
        }

Add the control to the screen
		<views:AutoDisplayControl x:Name="MyCustomControl"   
							  Grid.Row="1" 
                              ImagePath="ms-appx:///Images/Audi_R8.png" 
                               Title="Here is my title" SubTitle="here is my sub title" />

Run the application -> show it working

setup the enabled/disabled state
Wire up the enable changed in the main dashboard
 MyCustomControl.IsEnabled = !MyCustomControl.IsEnabled;

Put this in the OnApplyTemplate
	this.IsEnabledChanged += OnIsEnabledChanged;

Create the event handler
        private void OnIsEnabledChanged(object sender, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs dependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs)
        {
            if (this.IsEnabled)
            {
                VisualStateManager.GoToState(this, "Enabled", true);
            }
            else
            {
                VisualStateManager.GoToState(this, "Disabled", true);                
            }
        }

Setup the styles

	-> Disabled -> Make the text a green color
	-> Disabled -> enabled
		-> Make the text green
		-> Add a transition - 1s
	-> Enabled -> Disabled
		-> set opacity to 25% on the stack panel

Run the application -> show it working
