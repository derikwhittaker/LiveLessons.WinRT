Introduction
When building Windows 8 applications the user experiance should be one of the most important features you pay attention to.  It is paramount that your
application is both fluid and attractive.  one way to achive this type of UI is to use animations and story boards.  Storyboads allow for you to 
script out an animation in many different ways and allow for you to animate UI elements.  The ability to do this will allow you to build
a user experiance which is attractive and engaging.

* We are going to learn how to create basic animations using blend
* We are gonig to learn how to create trigger animations via their underlying story boards
* We are going to learn how to apply eashing functions and easing modes to our animations to give them smooth and fluid movement.

Summary
In this lesson we learned the how to use storyboards and animations to enhance the user experiance of your application.
* We learned how to create basic animations using blend
* We learned  how to create trigger animations via their underlying story boards
* We learned  how to apply eashing functions and easing modes to our animations to give them smooth and fluid movement.



* open the vs solution

* create the button and initial ellipse
            <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" Margin="25,0">
               <Button Command="{Binding BounceBallCommand}" Content=" Bounce Ball" />
               <Ellipse x:Name="Ball" Height="25" Width="25" Margin="25,0" Fill="Red" />
           </StackPanel>

* open blend
* create the BounceBallStoryboard
	* this storyboard should move the ball up, down, middle

	* run the storyboard in blend
* go back to VS
* setup the command for the button -> mention we are going to raise event to trigger the story board
        public RelayCommand BounceBallCommand
        {
            get { return _bounceBallCommand ?? (_bounceBallCommand = new RelayCommand(BounceBall)); }
        }

        private void BounceBall()
        {
            OnPropertyChanged("BounceBall");
        }
* wire up the story board in the code behind
vm.PropertyChanged += OnPropertyChanged;

        private void OnPropertyChanged(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs propertyChangedEventArgs)
        {
            switch (propertyChangedEventArgs.PropertyName)
            {
                case "BounceBall":
                    BounceBallStoryboard.Begin();
                    break;
            }
        }

* run the application, show the ball bouncing.  point out that the animation works great but it is not very fluid.  this is because of the animation type -- Keyframe

* setup the 2nd animation

* add the button/ellipse to the dashbaord
 <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" Margin="25,0">
                <Button Command="{Binding SmoothBounceBallCommand}" Content="Smooth Bounce Ball" />
                <Canvas x:Name="SmoothBallCanvas" Margin="25,0" RenderTransformOrigin="0.5,0.5" >
                	<Canvas.RenderTransform>
                		<CompositeTransform/>
                	</Canvas.RenderTransform>
                    <Ellipse  Height="25" Width="25" Fill="Yellow" />
                </Canvas>
                
            </StackPanel>

* Create the animation in blend --> select the canvas

* run the animation in blend

* wire up the button command

        public RelayCommand SmoothBounceBallCommand
        {
            get { return _smoothBounceBallCommand ?? (_smoothBounceBallCommand = new RelayCommand(SmoothBounceBall)); }
        }

        private void SmoothBounceBall()
        {
            OnPropertyChanged("SmoothBounceBall");
        }

* wire up the storyboard in the code behind
                case "SmoothBounceBall":                    
                    SmoothBouceBallStoryboard.Begin();
                    break;

* Run the application

* talk about how it only runs one time, how do we run it over and over
SmoothBouceBallStoryboard.RepeatBehavior = new RepeatBehavior{Type = RepeatBehaviorType.Forever};

* run the application

* setup the animation w/ easing

* setup the button/elipse
           <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" Margin="25,0">
                <Button Command="{Binding EasingBounceBallCommand}" Content="Easing Bounce Ball" />
                <Canvas x:Name="EasingBallCanvas" Margin="25,0" RenderTransformOrigin="0.5,0.5" >
                    <Canvas.RenderTransform>
                        <CompositeTransform/>
                    </Canvas.RenderTransform>
                    <Ellipse  Height="25" Width="25" Fill="Green" />
                </Canvas>

            </StackPanel>

* create the animation but this time do it by hand, explain that some animations are a bit easier in VS
	then they are in blend, or at least less trouble
		<Storyboard x:Name="EasingBouceBallStoryboard">
			<DoubleAnimation x:Name="EasingAnimation" 
                             Storyboard.TargetProperty="(UIElement.RenderTransform).(CompositeTransform.TranslateY)" 
                             Storyboard.TargetName="EasingBallCanvas"
                             Duration="0:0:3"
                             RepeatBehavior="Forever"
                             From="0"
                             To="-250"
                             />
		</Storyboard>

* Wire up the button command
        public RelayCommand EasingBounceBallCommand
        {
            get { return _easingBounceBallCommand ?? (_easingBounceBallCommand = new RelayCommand(EasingBounceBall)); }
        }

        private void EasingBounceBall()
        {
            OnPropertyChanged("EasingBounceBall");
        }

* run the app

* talk about easing functions
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/ee308751(v=vs.100).aspx

* add an easing function to the easing bounce --> first with no mode
                    EasingAnimation.EasingFunction = new BounceEase();

* run the application

* talk about easing modes, these change the way the easing will be applied to the animation
* add the mode
                    EasingAnimation.EasingFunction = new BounceEase
                        {
                            EasingMode = EasingMode.EaseIn
                        };
