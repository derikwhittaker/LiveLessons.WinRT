Hello I am derik whittaker and I am going to be your instructor for this live lesson

I have been building .net based applications for last 12 years.  OVer this time I have
build client server applications, browswer based applications as well as mobile applications.

I am a C# MVP, a member of the ASP Insiders group and a frequent speaker at various usergroups and 
developer conferences around the country.

IN this live lesson we are going to dive into the world of building Windows 8 Modern UI applications
with C# and XAML. I will assume you have a working knowledge of both C# as well as XAML, but we 
still cover many of the basic skills needed to build a modern UI application.

In order to build a Windows 8 Modern UI application you will need to have a computer running
windows 8 as well as Visual Studio 2012

Lets go ahead and talk about the content of our lessons
