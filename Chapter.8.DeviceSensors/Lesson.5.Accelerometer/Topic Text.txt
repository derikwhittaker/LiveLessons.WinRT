Introduction
When building Windows 8 applications you may need to access some of the many available sensors which may be on your users device.
One of the many sensors you can use a developer is the Accelerometer sensor.  the Accelerometer sensor can be used to get a acceleration force of the device
on the x y and z axis, or basicaly measure how fast it is moving in any given direction.  This information can be used to move objects around on the screen.  
One of the more common usages for the gyrometer is in games. With this sensor you can allow the users to control the game play by simply tilting the device.

* we are going to learn how to attach to the Accelerometer sensor
* we are going to learn how to deteremine if the Accelerometer sensor is available on your users device
* we are going to learn how to get X Y and Z acceleration data values via eventing
* we are going to learn how to get X Y and Z acceleration shack values via eventing
* we are going to learn how to get X Y and Z acceleration values  via polling

Summary
In this lesson we learned how to use the built in Accelerometer sensor on your users device to get the acceleration forces of the device on the X Y and Z axis
