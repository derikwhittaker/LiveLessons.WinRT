Introduction
When building Windows 8 applications you may need to access some of the many available sensors and hardware features which are available on users devices.
One of the many sensors and features in which a developer can access is Accelerometer sensor.  the Accelerometer sensor can be used to get a acceleration force of the device
on the x y and z axis, or basicaly measure how fast it is moving in any given direction.  

* we are going to learn how to attach to the Accelerometer sensor
* we are going to learn how to deteremine if the Accelerometer sensor is available on your users device
* we are going to learn how to get X Y and Z acceleration data values via eventing
* we are going to learn how to get X Y and Z acceleration shack values via eventing
* we are going to learn how to get X Y and Z acceleration values  via polling

Summary
In this lesson we learned how to use the built in Accelerometer sensor on your users device to get the acceleration forces of the device on the X Y and Z axis
* we learned how to attach to the Accelerometer sensor
* we learned how to deteremine if the Accelerometer sensor is available on your users device
* we learned how to get X Y and Z acceleration values via eventing
