Introduction
When building Windows 8 applications you may need to access some of the many available sensors which may be on your users device.
One of the many sensors you can use a developer is the light sensor.  the light sensor can be used to get a reading on the ambient light level
in Lux Value.  But what is a Lux level?  Lux readings are directly proportional to the energy per square meter that is absorbed per second. 
Human perception of light levels is not so straightforward. Human perception of light is complicated because our eyes are constantly adjusting 
and other biological processes are affecting our perception. However, we can think of this perception from a simplified perspective by creating 
several ranges of interest with known upper and lower thresholds.

* we are going to learn how to attach to the light sensor
* we are going to learn how to deteremine if the light sensor is available on your users device
* we are going to learn how to get Lux values via eventing
* we are going to learn how to get Lux values via polling

Summary
In this lesson we learned how to use the built in light sensor on your users device to get the Lux readin
* we learned how to attach to the light sensor
* we learned how to deteremine if the light sensor is available on your users device
* we learned how to get Lux values via eventing
* we learned how to get Lux values via polling


* setup the light sensor
	* create using block because of nameing issues
	using Sensor = Windows.Devices.Senors;

	private Sensor.LightSensor _lightSensor;

        private void SetupLightSensor()
        {
            _lightSensor = Sensor.LightSensor.GetDefault();

            if (_lightSensor == null)
            {
                LuxLums = "Your current device does not suppor the light sensor";
            }
        }

* how to setup polling
