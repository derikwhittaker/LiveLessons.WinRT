Introduction
When building Windows 8 applications you may need to access some of the many available sensors and hardware features which are available on users devices.
One of the many sensors and features in which a developer can access is light sensor.  the light sensor can be used to get a reading on the ambient light level
in Lux Value.  But what is a Lux level?  Lux readings are directly proportional to the energy per square meter that is absorbed per second. Put simply this sensor
allows you to measure the amount light around device as well as get information when the light levels change.


* we are going to learn how to attach to the light sensor
* we are going to learn how to deteremine if the light sensor is available on your users device
* we are going to learn how to get Lux values via eventing
* we are going to learn how to get Lux values via polling

Summary
In this lesson we learned how to use the built in light sensor on your users device to get the Lux readin
* we learned how to attach to the light sensor
* we learned how to deteremine if the light sensor is available on your users device
* we learned how to get Lux values via eventing
* we learned how to get Lux values via polling

* show http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd319008(VS.85).aspx which explains the value of Lux

* setup the light sensor
	* create using block because of nameing issues
	using Sensor = Windows.Devices.Senors;

	private Sensor.LightSensor _lightSensor;

        private void SetupLightSensor()
        {
            _lightSensor = Sensor.LightSensor.GetDefault();

            if (_lightSensor == null)
            {
                LuxLums = "Your current device does not suppor the light sensor";
            }
        }

* how to setup eventing
	* create a method called SetupEventing
        private void SetupEventing(bool enableEventing)
        {
            if (enableEventing)
            {
                _lightSensor.ReadingChanged += LightSensorOnReadingChanged;
                _lightSensor.ReportInterval = 100;
                CurrentReadingStyle = "Eventing";
            }
            else
            {
                _lightSensor.ReadingChanged -= LightSensorOnReadingChanged;
                CurrentReadingStyle = "Stopped";
            }
        }

	* setup the handler, but with NO thread safty first
        private void LightSensorOnReadingChanged(Sensor.LightSensor sender, Sensor.LightSensorReadingChangedEventArgs args)
        {
		var lightSensorReading = args.Reading;
		LuxLums = string.Format("{0,5:0.00}", lightSensorReading.IlluminanceInLux);
                Brightness = lightSensorReading.IlluminanceInLux / 100;

        }

	Call Setup() from the ToggleEventing

* Add the thread safty
	public DashboardViewModel( CoreDispatcher dispatcher )
        {
            _dispatcher = dispatcher;
            PageTitle = "Learning to use Light Sensor";
            
            SetupLightSensor();
        }

        private async void LightSensorOnReadingChanged(Sensor.LightSensor sender, Sensor.LightSensorReadingChangedEventArgs args)
        {
            // when doing this for real show the thread event


            await _dispatcher.RunAsync(CoreDispatcherPriority.Normal, () =>
                                                                         {
                                                                             var lightSensorReading = args.Reading;

                                                                             LuxLums = string.Format("{0,5:0.00}", lightSensorReading.IlluminanceInLux);
                                                                             Brightness = lightSensorReading.IlluminanceInLux / 100;
                                                                         });

        }

* setup the polling
	* create the timer
	private DispatcherTimer _dispatcherTimer;

	* create the setuppolling method
        private void SetupPolling(bool enablePolling)
        {
            if ( enablePolling )
            {
                _dispatcherTimer = new DispatcherTimer();
                _dispatcherTimer.Interval = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 1);
                _dispatcherTimer.Tick += DispatcherTimerOnTick;

                _dispatcherTimer.Start();

                CurrentReadingStyle = "Polling";
            }
            else
            {
                _dispatcherTimer.Stop();
                _dispatcherTimer = null;

                CurrentReadingStyle = "Stopped";
            }
        }

        private void DispatcherTimerOnTick(object sender, object o)
        {
            var lightSensorReading = _lightSensor.GetCurrentReading();

            LuxLums = string.Format("{0,5:0.00}", lightSensorReading.IlluminanceInLux);
            Brightness = lightSensorReading.IlluminanceInLux / 100;
        }

	SetupPolling(IsPolling);
